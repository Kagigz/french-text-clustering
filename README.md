# French Text Clustering

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook showing how to cluster French text using the CamemBERT model.
As a example, I'm using Amazon purchases and clustering the items to see how much is spent by category.

Other possible use cases: clustering comments, tweets, questions, etc.

You can download this notebook and run it as is after installing dependencies. The [dataset](sample_data/amazondata.xlsx) used is provided in this repo, but you can use your own dataset as well. Make sure to adapt the code if your dataset has different column names.
